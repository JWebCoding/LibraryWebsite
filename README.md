# Library Website

## Overview:

	This website acts as a companion piece to the [dekstop application](https://github.com/JWebCoding/LibraryDesktop/). Where the desktop app's role 
	is to facilitate nearly any form of interaction I may ever need with the database. The 
	website's purpose is to offer a muchmore streamlined, convenient and accessible form of access 
	to the two most importan functions of the dekstop application; those being the ability to view 
	existing books and to add new ones. 

---------------------------
## Structure:

	Like most websites in existence, this website is made up of two distint halves, a frontend and 
	a backend. The frontend is built using a cmobination of **React.js**, **CSS** and **HTML/JSX**. 
	The backend is written entirely in **Java Spring-Boot**. Both sides have a fair amount of code 
	and are currently quite functional but much work still needs to be done.s
